## TODO
- [ ] Implement `#instantiate_observers`
- [x] New structure to replace ObserverArray
  - [ ] Each ORM (i.e. `ActiveRecord::Base`) will have a class method `#pending_observees` returning a array of all fully-qualified model names (as strings) to begin observing upon inheritance.
  - [ ] Each ORM observer class (i.e. `ActiveRecord::Observer`) will have a class method (`#descendant_instances`) returning an array of all observers (objects).
  - [ ] Each observer will have an `#current_observees` class method which will return an array (of strings) the models the observer observes.
  - [ ] Each model will have an `#observers` class method which will obtain an array of observer objects observing the model.
- [x] Only strings can be 'observed'. (Anything that responds to #to_s is converted. Warnings are raised for Classes.)
- [ ] Upon setting up observers, instantiate them, but don't rush to load the classes they observe. instead, hook into those by monitoring the inherit callbacks of `Active*::Base`
  - [x] This means observers specify their classes with symbols or strings. *NOT* constants.
- [ ] ObserverArray should *only* store Observer instances. No need to store observer classes at all. (Can create a delegator to helpful methods in the class.)

## Checks
- [ ] Probably a better idea to change functionality since this is a major version change rather than have deprecators strewn all over the place.
- [ ] I have a strong bias for `prepend` nowadays. Check to see if when I use `prepend` it's really preferable over `include`/`extend`.
- [ ] Document all changes (especially backward-incompatible ones).
- [ ] Make sure documentation is pretty and where it belongs.
- [ ] Optimize autoloading, etc. (Perhaps last?)
- [ ] Writeup upgrade instructions (noting backwards-incompatible changes).
  - [ ] Perhaps write an upgrade generator(?)
- [ ] Cause deprecator to raise errors in testing mode. (Fix/complete it in general)
- [ ] Confirm bootstrapper works for non-rails.
- [ ] Make sure enablement is working (I'm pretty sure I broke it)
- [ ] Make sure I didn't break anything that was threadsafe
- [ ] Add tests for any new functionality you write
- [ ] Check for all TODOs, FIXMEs, etc

## Summary of Changes
- Added Bundler confifiguration setting to make `:github` source in `Gemfile` use `HTTPS`. (Was triggering warning with latest Bundler.)
- Restructured directories and code locations so that it would make intuitive sense (and also so that code would be compatible with autoloaders without manual `require`s or additional configuration).
- Removed reliance on `rails` and `railties` gems.
- You can no longer redefine the method #observed_classes in ActiveModel::Observer subclasses. You can either use `observe :class` or `observed_classes = :class`
